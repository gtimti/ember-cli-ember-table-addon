**NOTE**: This addon is a port from [http://addepar.github.io/ember-table](http://addepar.github.io/ember-table) into vanilla JS and ES6 style modules. The addon is still a work in progress.

# Ember Table

A table built using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) that lazily renders rows.

Ember Table allows you to handle very large data sets by only rendering the
rows that are being displayed. It is written as an ember component with an API
that is easy to understand and extend.
